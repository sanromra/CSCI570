# CSCI570
Project for USC CSCI570, Analysis of Algorithms

Project consists in finding the best alignment of two strings given in an input file.

The alignement was found in a time efficient way (algo_basic.py) and in a memory efficient way (algo_efficient.py).

Plots on time and memory efficiency can be found on CPUPlot.png and MemoryPlot.png. A summary of findings after the running of experiments can be found in Summary.txt.

This project was made together with Nishant Udgaonkar and Dimitar Kirilov.
